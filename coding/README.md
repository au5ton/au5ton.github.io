###The fundamentals
In order to ever get a grip on programming anything,
you need to understand the following.
Don't worry, I'll try my best to explain it to you.

- From your head to your screen

Simple enough? If not, don't worry.<br>
We'll get into stuff like the code below in due time.

```java

public class Example
{
  public static void main(String args[])
  {
    System.out.println("Hey, listen!");
    System.out.println(explain());
  }
  public static String explain()
  {
    return "Zelda referrence!";
  }
}

```
